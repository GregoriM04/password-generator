# Password genretator with JavaScript

## Get a new random password on a few clicks

This little project came to my mind when I needed a strong random password for my account. So, I opened my best designing tool software (aka. Powerpoint, not kidding) and drew a simple interface of inputs and buttons needed.

Then, I refined some details, like color and positioning, and when I sorted it out, I got my hands on the code.

The HTML and CSS structure was pretty straightforward. But the JavaScript functionally was a challenge, especially because I didn't have much experience manipulating and getting things done the way I intended.

However, after some consistency and many questions on Google, I managed to get the result I wanted in the first place. And that makes me feel good because I know this is just the beginning, and there is much more to do. (Now that I think about it, this is the storytelling behind this project:))

Lastly, I added a transition effect to the generated password to give the impression that it is being generated step by step instead of instantly appearing when clicking the button.
